               <h2>Godwin Kachi</h2>
               <p class="intro">Godwin was born some years ago in the ancient town of Enugu. Growing up was 
                    quite interesting for him as he loved most of the things he had to engage himself with even in 
                    those early years.</p>
               <p class="intro_body">Over the years, Godwin has gained experience working in the capacity of managing 
                    multiple businesses within the professional and non-professional space, which has accorded him a handful
                    of experience across Electricals, Automobile, Education, Agric and Health Industries.
               </p>
               <p class="intro_body">He is a firm believer of the school of thought that prioritizes skills and integrity
                    before monetary and immediate gratification, hence, his zeal to invest into people the various skills that
                    will help them not only to grow but also enable them to cascade in the various communities they may find themselves.
               </p>
